# Movie Rating Prediction System

## Project Description
Movie ratings play an important role in influencing audience decisions on online platforms such as IMDb. Predicting these ratings manually is difficult due to the number of factors involved. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict movie ratings based on various movie attributes.

## Objectives
- To analyze movie data and understand factors affecting ratings
- To preprocess and clean the dataset
- To implement and compare different regression models
- To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Dataset
- Source: IMDb Movie Dataset (Kaggle)
- Format: CSV
- Target Variable: Movie Rating

### Features Used
- Genre
- Runtime
- Vote Count
- Gross
- Rating

## Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Encoding and Selection
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Result Comparison

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared Score (R²)

## Results
Among all models, Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance with the lowest error values and highest R² score.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively predict movie ratings. Ensemble models perform better than simple regression models.
